**Unit 3: Marketing** <span id="3"></span> 
*The process of marketing found its way into the business mindset around
1950.  Marketingis the activity, set of institutions, and processes for
creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have
value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.  It is a
process that involves activities and communication designed to persuade
buyers to buy, and through research, give customers what they want.
 Before you enrolled in this course, you may have perceived marketing as
only advertising and selling.  You will find that it encompasses the
areas of publicity, public relations, and sales promotion.  Through the
marketing process, businesses are able to tailor a product or service to
their target market.*
