**Unit 2: Entrepreneurship and Legal Forms of Business** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit will illustrate how the various forms of ownership (sole
proprietorship, partnerships, and corporations) that an owner chooses
affects how that business is taxed, how profits are distributed, and
what regulations are to be followed.  Through careful study, as a
potential owner, you will decide in which form you are the most
comfortable operating.  You will also see that in some situations, it is
necessary to move from one form of ownership to another.  The form of
ownership you choose will directly correspond to the growth, taxation,
and future of your company.*
