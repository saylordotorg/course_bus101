Course Syllabus for "BUS101: Introduction to Business"
------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever wondered what qualities billionaire Warren Buffet,
visionary Steve Jobs, or upcoming Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com all have in
common? After you finish studying business practices in this course, you
may discover that you have some of the same qualities as other
successful entrepreneurs. This course is designed as a survey course
that will expose you to business terminology, concepts, and current
business issues. The intent is to develop a viable business vocabulary,
foster critical and analytical thinking, and refine your business
decision-making skills. These skills will be acquired by the reading
materials, exercises, and research assignments in this course that
simulate the workplace today. By delving into the five units of this
course, you will be able to fine tune your direction and choice of
career in business. A major goal of your education is to help you become
a citizen who can contribute and compete in an increasingly global
environment. Elements of this course will focus on multicultural aspects
of markets and business. Additional elements will ask you to look at
other countries and evaluate the combination of business models and
country characteristics.

### Course Information

**Welcome to BUS101, Introduction to Business.** Below, please find some
general information about the course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Sharon Dexter  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges: Leslie
    Lum’s [*Introduction to Business: Readings and
    Workbook*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bus101-Book-May2011.pdf)
-   [*Exploring
    Business*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Exploring%20Business.pdf)

**Requirements for Completions:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
later units.  You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam 

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments listed above and all resources for each
unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **132.75**
**hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These
should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 19.75 hours. Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete the textbook
reading for subunit 1.1 (10 hours) over the course of 4 days, so each
day you will read 2.5 hours from Monday night through Thursday night;
then read subunit 1.2 on Friday; etc.   
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Your success in this course will depend on
careful attention to detail in addition to a time management system you
develop. Setting aside adequate time for completion of assignments and
reading will be important. Learning is an ongoing process, and you will
have challenges along the way. As a self-disciplined student, you will
be in the driver’s seat to meet those challenges. Make sure to take
notes on the resources you encounter in this course, and keep the
learning outcomes, listed at the beginning of the course and at the
beginning of each unit, in mind as you take notes. These notes will
serve as a useful review as you begin to study for the Final Exam.
