**Unit 1: The Context of Business** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit covers basic macroeconomic concepts which provide the context
for business.*  *This unit will explore economic and historical
information that aids in government decisions today but also provides a
foundation for future decision-making.  The events related to the
financial meltdown of 2008 such as the bailout of AIG, Lehman Brothers,
and General Motors provide teachable moments for such areas as economic
policy and business cycles.  This unit attempts to draw in multiple
sources of information and several great documentaries that have been
created lately concerning the 2008 economic crisis while giving you an
introduction to the context of business.*   *A quote referring to two
business cycles that you will study still holds true today: “It’s a
recession when your neighbor loses his job; it’s a depression when you
lose yours.” - Harry S. Truman*

    country has grown because technology has lowered the cost of
    producing goods and services.  As you read these pages, please note
    that for this first section, you are focusing on macroeconomics more
    than microeconomics, which includes gross domestic product,
    unemployment rate, and price indexes.  Make sure to click on any
    embedded hyperlinks in the course textbook for further suggested
    reading.  This resource covers the topics outlined in subunits 1.2
    and 1.3, including any inclusive sub-subunits.  
        
     This reading should take you approximately 10 hours to complete. It
    is recommended that you break this reading up over the course of 3
    or 4 days.

**1.2.2 Nominal and Real GDP Growth** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading from the BUS101 textbook
assigned below subunit 1.1 (pg. 51-147).  In the BUS101 textbook, as GDP
is explained, there is also a historical perspective provided.
Specifically focus on page 55, where there are forms of GDP growth
provided.  The high GDP in the United States allows Americans a high
standard of living.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. Read this entire
    section for an understanding of economic goals and growth.  If we
    view solely the GDP, we are not given any indication of the health
    of the economy.  It is the change in GDP that is relevant. If GDP
    goes up, the economy is growing. This positive movement is what we
    want as we leave behind the most recent recession.  Complete the
    Exercises at the end of the reading.  Please note that this reading
    covers the topics for sub-subunit 1.3.8 and inclusive sub-subunits
    1.3.8.1 through 1.3.8.6.  
        
     This reading and Exercises should take approximately 1 hour to

    Business: Readings and
    Workbook](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bus101-Book-May2011.pdf).
     Studying GDP per capita will allow you to compare one country to
    another.  As you review this resource, answer the following
    questions:  
      
          1.      Why is the U.S. GDP per capita higher than China?  
          2.      How is GDP per capita found?  
      
     You should spend approximately 30 minutes studying this resource,

**1.2.4 Inflation** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
-   **Web Media: New York Times’ “All of Inflation’s Little Parts”**
    Link: *New York Times’* “[All of Inflation’s Little
    Parts](http://nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/03/business/20080403_SPENDING_GRAPHIC.html)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above to access the *New York
    Times* website.  Then, please read the brief text below the title
    and explore the interactive graph, which will give you insight into
    the rate of inflation as it impacts the global economy.  As the rate
    of inflation increases, there is a decline in your purchasing power
    as a consumer.  The rapid increase in the price of gasoline alone
    has caused fear in the eyes of the consumer.  This interactive media
    explains the many parts of inflation in addition to representing an
    average consumer’s spending.  List three main ways that inflation
    impacts your life as a student.  Refer to page 70 in Leslie Lum’s
    [*Introduction to Business: Readings and
    Workbook*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bus101-Book-May2011.pdf). 
    The graph entitled Inflation Rate at the top of the page shows the
    direction inflation has gone from 1914 to 2007.  (source:
    [bls.gov](http://bls.gov/)).  Review this graph and read the text
    below it.  High interest rates can hurt businesses because consumers
    are less likely to buy when interest rates are high.  Additionally
    businesses find it expensive to purchase equipment and other
    overhead they may need to prosper.  Please note that reviewing this
    graph also covers the topic outlined in sub-subunit 1.2.5.  
        
     You should spend approximately 1 hour studying this resource,
    listing ways inflation impacts your life, and reviewing the
    information on inflation in the course textbook.

**1.2.5 Consumer Price Index** <span id="1.2.5"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 1.1
in the BUS101 textbook* [*Introduction to Business: Readings and
Workbook*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bus101-Book-May2011.pdf)*. 
You have reviewed the graph on page 70 of Lum’s textbook in the previous
sub-subunit 1.2.4; this graph will help you better understand the
Consumer Price Index.*  *The Consumer Price Index has many uses by
government and business. CPI tracks the spending habits of 10,000 people
over the course of a month.  The CPI as it relates to inflation rates
will tell the consumer how well the government is keeping inflation
under control.  A business may use it to calculate the cost of living
increases to its employees.  The U.S. government will use it to compute
increases in Social Security.*

**1.3 Components of Economic Policy** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 1.1. 
To cover this topic, please focus on page 77 of the reading for an
overview of the workings of the U.S. government and its policies.*

    Link: U.S. Debt Clock’s “[Debt Clock Time
    Machine](http://www.usdebtclock.org/)” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click the link above, and study the debt clock
    time machine.  This media provides an excellent illustration of
    federal budget and cumulative debt.  The sum of all federal deficits
    makes up our national debt, which you will see in the upper left
    hand corner of this display.  Please notice how much debt is
    assigned to each U.S. citizen.  You should know the difference
    between a yearly surplus and deficit in the United States
    government, and then equate this to the national debt.   
        
     You should spend approximately 15 minutes studying this resource.

**1.3.2 Budget Deficit (Expenses Exceed Revenues)** <span
id="1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 1.1
in the BUS101 textbook,* [*Introduction to Business: Readings and
Workbook*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bus101-Book-May2011.pdf)*. 
In particular, focus on the text under “Fiscal Policy” on page 77 as
well as the graph on page 78 to learn about the definition of the budget
deficit. In the year of an election, the candidates promise to reduce
government spending.  Usually this does not happen.  The deficit in the
United States is growing with the continuation of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan.  The yearly deficit continues to add to the national debt. 
Some U.S. citizens think that government spending helps the economy
grow.  Others think that government spending comes out of the hands of
consumers and business owners, thereby slowing growth.  Write a
paragraph that expresses your thoughts on this argument.*

**1.3.3 Budget Surplus (Revenues Exceed Expenses)** <span
id="1.3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Exploring Business*: “Section 1.7: Government’s Role in
    Managing the Economy”**

    Managing the
    Economy”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Exploring%20Business.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  Read this entire
    section, particularly focusing on the selection under the heading of
    “National Debt” to learn about budget surplus.  It is quite unlikely
    that the United States will see a budget surplus in the near future.
     This situation is present when the tax revenues collected are
    greater than the expenses of the United States government.  Complete
    Exercise 1 at the end of the reading.  
        
     This reading and exercise should take approximately 30 minutes to
    complete.

the monetary policy that U.S. government has in place.  This policy
manages the money supply under the control of the Federal Reserve
Board.*
